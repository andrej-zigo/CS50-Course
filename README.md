## 📂 About the Repository

An integral part of the course is submitting labs, problem sets, and the final project for feedback. This repository contains my solutions for the problem sets and labs. The final project is in a separate repository, the link is provided below. Additionally, you can find links and short descriptions for each project, along with implementation requirements in each project folder.

## 📕 Academic Honesty

Be mindful of the course's [academic honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/honesty/). Attempt to solve problems independently before consulting other implementations. Keep in mind that I am a beginner, taking the course to learn, so the solutions may not be optimal.
