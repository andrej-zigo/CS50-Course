Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Prediction of 10 simulations proved to be incorrect. It was absolutely random.


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It stabilized after 100 simulations pretty much. But I would call my predictions good enough after 1000 simulations.
