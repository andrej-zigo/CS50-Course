First Question:
1. I will calculate average of each value (energy, valence, danceability).
2. I expect that I have the information of ratio of values across all music genres.
   Afterward I will compare calculated values to the values in all music genres.
3. Using this inofrmation I will create "Audio Aura" specific for the listener's
   preferences.


Second Question:
This approach may not always be representative because a listener might
favor specific artists and their unique compositions more than a particular music genre.
Additionally, the music may feature artists from different countries, resulting in
songs with languages the listener might not understand. These factors could pose
challenges when using the suggested solution.
